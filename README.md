# Overview
# Crochet Counter
A watch app that helps crocheters keep track of what row they are on. It alerts them what they are a quarter, halfway, three-quarters, 
and done with the project that they are working on. 

I personally love to crochet and it is very hard to keep track of what row I am on. Oftentimes, when I use
row counters, they fall out and are just incovenient. I wanted to create an app that would keep track of this for me.

# Development Environment
I used Android Studio and the Watch emulator to develop this software.

This app was created with Kotlin.
